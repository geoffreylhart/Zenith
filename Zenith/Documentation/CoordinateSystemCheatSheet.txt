From now on, let's make everything make sense!!! No hacks!!
x, y -> longitude, latitude
Latitude forms horizontal rings (x=0 means the equator)
Monogames default screen space coordinates has 0,0 as the top-left and 800,480 as the bottom-right (you can discover this bias by simply printing the mouse coordinates)
Since lat/long don't naturally have a positive or negative direction, we'll take inspiration from Google's API:
	- Because of this, travelling right should increase your longitude, while travelling up should increase your latitude

We'll imagine that our default Blender scene is pointing at 0,0 on the Earth on startup
The default Blender scene has a camera at (0,-5,0), pointing at (0,0,0)
	- Up is Z+ (towards the north pole)
	- Right is X+ (towards east)
	- Forwards (towards the Earth) is Y+

In Blender (using XYZ Euler rotation), moving right is equivalent to orbiting positively around the Z axis
	- And moving up is orbiting .... wait isn't it ambiguous??

Try to make sure in function parameters, longitude should come before latitude to make it more obvious it's X, Y (I still have it reversed in a lot of places)
Amazingly it looks like Monogame has the same handedness as Blender?? Based on our rendering of the BlenderAxis matching

ACCORDING TO MY OWN COMMENTS, you have to draw triangles clockwise to make them visible (counter-clockwise triangles are culled (it's a default setting somewhere))
