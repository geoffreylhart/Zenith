game mechanics as upgrades
	- such as the ability to survey planets without using your spaceship
	- survey stations (think xcom)
	- ability to slow/stop time under certain conditions, globally or for specific squad members, or in space combat
	- ability to show percentage chance to hit things, or distribution

how to fix non-fun issue of ev where you just buy all software because its super cheap? dont make it cheap, dont make it software?
	- make it like xcom or moo2 or anything

 - morale damage weapons
 - adjustablilty being a perk for a spaceship, cheaply switching out different weapons without retrofitting
 - can't see enemies until they're called in? (maybe they get spooked and ramble sometimes, just giving you an idea something's there)
 - complex xcom stats that can be processed (even if modded) to give you more useful info. Also, research to learn stats.
